/**
 * Light / dark theme state.
 *
 * The theme is a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`; every colour in the app
 * resolves through a custom property that flips on that attribute, so switching
 * costs one attribute write and no re-render of anything but the toggle.
 *
 * First paint is handled by the inline script in `index.html`, not here — an
 * effect runs after paint and would flash the light ground. This module owns
 * the same storage key and must stay in step with it.
 *
 * `window` is never touched during render: the initial state is read in a
 * layout effect. That keeps the module safe to import from a server-rendered
 * tree under the Next.js port (DESIGN.md §3.1), where the same inline script
 * would move into `app/layout.tsx`.
