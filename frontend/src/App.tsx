/**
 * Route tree.
 *
 * Structured to mirror a Next.js `app/` directory one-for-one, so the port
 * described in DESIGN.md §3.1 is mechanical:
 *
 *   /              -> app/(public)/page.tsx
 *   /a/:slug       -> app/(public)/a/[slug]/page.tsx
 *   /about         -> app/(public)/about/page.tsx
 *   /join, /you    -> app/(public)/...
 *   /contact       -> app/(public)/contact/page.tsx
 *   /review/*      -> app/(review)/...  (noindex, authenticated)
 *
 * **The review desk lives at `/review`, not `/console`, and renders none of the
 * public chrome.** The old tree mounted `SiteHeader` above the router, so the
 * console rendered the public wordmark and the public nav advertised a link
 * nobody without an account could use. Now the two groups share nothing but
 * this file: the public group gets `SiteHeader` and the mobile tab bar, the
 * review group brings its own header, and no public surface links to it. The
 * gate itself is unchanged and is still the only thing that matters for access
 * — a URL is not a secret, `RequireAuth` and the server's bearer check are what
 * keep readers out.
 *
 * Public routes never import from `features/console`, and the review desk never
 * renders public chrome — the same separation the backend has between
 * `api/public` and `api/console`.
