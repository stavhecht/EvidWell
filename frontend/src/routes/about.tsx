/**
 * About.
 *
 * The copy is the comp's, and the three numbered rules at the bottom are not
 * marketing — each one names a mechanism that exists in the code and can be
 * checked:
 *
 *   1. every published article carries its sources (`article_sources`, and the
 *      citation validation that runs before persistence)
 *   2. evidence grade and quantity cap verdict confidence
 *      (`evidence/grading.py`, invariant #3)
 *   3. `ReviewService.approve()` is the only assignment of `published` in the
 *      system, and a test greps the AST to keep it that way (invariant #1)
 *
 * If any of those stops being true, this page becomes a false claim rather than
 * a stale one — which is the reason for spelling out which is which here.

        You.th was built out of a real need to stop misinformation on social
        media, and to become a place where medical, health and aesthetic
        information can be passed on honestly. Everything here is based on
        published research.

      <p className={ABOUT_LEAD}>
        Our team is driven by an interest in health and lifestyle, and believes
        everyone deserves access to real information. In a fast-moving,
        information-heavy generation, it matters that it arrives in a form you
        can actually use.
