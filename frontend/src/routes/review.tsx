/**
 * The review desk, as a lazy-loaded bundle.
 *
 * Default-exports its own nested `<Routes>` so App.tsx can `lazy()` the whole
 * subtree — the desk carries the TipTap editor, and the public feed must not pay
 * for it.
 *
 * **It renders its own chrome and none of the public site's.** That is the
 * structural half of moving it off `/console` and behind `/review`: the two
 * surfaces now share nothing but the route table, so a reviewer is never looking
 * at a reader's search box and the public header never carries a link to a
 * screen only staff can open. Access itself is unchanged and is not about the
 * URL — a path is not a secret. `RequireAuth` gates the client, and every
 * `/api/console/*` route is behind a router-level bearer check that a reader's
 * token cannot satisfy: it is minted with a different `typ` claim and is
 * rejected before the user lookup even runs.
 *
 * Under a Next.js port this becomes a `(review)` route group marked noindex:
 * the queue must never be crawlable.
