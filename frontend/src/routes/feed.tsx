/**
 * The public feed.
 *
 * The masthead the previous design opened with — a display-size statement of
 * what the product is — is gone, replaced by the comp's hero: the footage full
 * bleed with one serif line over it. The claim is the same and the register is
 * not, which is the point of the redesign. The promise it used to make in a
 * standfirst is now the line under the grid, where a reader arrives at it
 * having already seen what it is about.
 *
 * Narrowing lives in the URL and is read through `useBrowseState`, so the
 * header's search box, the drawer's categories and this page are three views of
 * one piece of state rather than three copies of it.
