/**
 * Keeps `attrs.beat` alive through an edit.
 *
 * The body is three beat paragraphs, and the server addresses them by
 * `attrs.beat` rather than by position — `services/tiptap.py::beat_text()`,
 * which the feed card excerpt is derived from, and which stays correct when a
 * reviewer inserts an image above beat 1 (see MediaNodes.ts).
 *
 * TipTap drops attributes the schema does not declare. Without this extension
 * StarterKit's plain `paragraph` parses the loaded document, discards `beat`,
 * and the first autosave writes an `edited_content` in which no paragraph is
 * addressable any more — the feed then renders those articles with an empty
 * excerpt, silently, because nothing about the document is otherwise wrong.
 *
 * Declared as a global attribute rather than a replacement paragraph node so
 * StarterKit keeps ownership of the node itself.
