/**
 * Trend proposals from the fortnightly scan.
 *
 * The evidence-backed counterpart to the free-text New-run box below it: same
 * action, but the topic came from counting what the literature is actually
 * doing rather than from what a reviewer happened to think of.
 *
 * Three decisions worth keeping.
 *
 * **Collapsed by default.** Eight always-open rows push the review queue below
 * the fold, and the queue is why a reviewer opened this screen. The badge in
 * the header is enough to say "there is something here" without spending the
 * space to prove it — and it is drawn only when the count is non-zero, because
 * a circled 0 is a mark that means "ignore me".
 *
 * **Run scan is here rather than only in cron.** A reviewer who has just
 * cleared the list should not wait until Monday to see whether anything moved.
 * It is safe to expose because a scan *proposes* — no model calls, no queued
 * run, no spend — so the money still sits behind Generate draft, one press
 * further in. It is styled as the quietest control in the panel for the same
 * reason: it costs nothing of ours and several minutes of NCBI's.
 *
 * **Every row shows its arithmetic.** "17 papers, usually 3" is the claim; the
 * score is not shown at all. The ranking is built from constants that were
 * guessed before any real data existed, so a reviewer needs to be able to
 * disagree with it — and a bare score invites either belief or dismissal, never
 * judgement. The study mix is there for the same reason: six case reports and
 * six randomised trials are the same surge and a very different proposition.
 *
 * Promoting spends a full generation run. Nothing it produces publishes without
 * an approval, so the button is `PRIMARY` rather than guarded — but it says so.
