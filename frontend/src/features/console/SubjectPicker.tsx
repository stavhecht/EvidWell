/**
 * What kind of thing this article assesses.
 *
 * The one field on the review screen a reviewer *adds* rather than checks, and
 * the reason it exists at all: subject is the product's single chromatic axis
 * — it colours the tile, fills the browse drawer and is what a reader's
 * interests are expressed in — and it cannot be derived. `product` is free
 * text, so inferring "supplement" from "Creatine Monohydrate 5g" would put a
 * confident colour on a guess.
 *
 * Optional, and staying optional is deliberate. An unclassified article renders
 * in ink and sits under "Everything", which is the design's resting state
 * rather than a broken cell — so this must never block publication. "None" is
 * therefore a real choice in the row, not the absence of one.
 *
 * Writes immediately rather than through the editor's autosave: it is a single
 * enum on its own endpoint, it is legal after publication (unlike the body),
 * and folding it into the content PATCH would make correcting a colour on a
 * live article impossible.
