/**
 * The `image` and `youtube` TipTap nodes.
 *
 * Both are block-level atoms, the same shape as `CitationNode.ts` and for the
 * same reason: a reviewer may place one or remove one, never edit its insides.
 * What is inside is not prose — it is a path the upload endpoint issued and an
 * eleven-character video id — and prose editing of either produces a `src`
 * that resolves to nothing. Atoms select whole and delete whole.
 *
 * Neither node holds a URL that anyone typed. The image node holds the path
 * the server returned from an upload, and `parseHTML` below refuses any other
 * shape, so a picture dragged in from another site never enters the document
 * at all. The video node holds an id, and the embed URL is built from it at
 * render time. Both are re-checked server-side on save and on approve
 * (`backend/app/services/media.py`) — that is the enforcement; this is the
 * half that keeps a reviewer from hitting it by accident.
 *
 * They are block-level rather than inline so that nothing they do can disturb
 * the three beats. Beat paragraphs are addressed by `attrs.beat`, so a picture
 * placed above beat 1 does not change which paragraph the feed card is derived
 * from.
