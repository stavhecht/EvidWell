/**
 * TipTap editor over the draft.
 *
 * Loads `editedContent ?? originalContent` and saves only to edited content.
 * The `Citation` node makes citations first-class rather than prose (see
 * CitationNode.ts for why that matters), and `ArticleImage` / `YouTubeEmbed`
 * do the same for the two things a reviewer can add that the model cannot
 * (see MediaNodes.ts).
 *
 * The editing surface is drawn as a recessed panel on the ground with a rule
 * around it — the same inversion the console's text fields use. In a system
 * with no corner radius, the border is the only thing that can say "this region
 * is yours to change", and the reviewer needs to know that at a glance on a
 * screen where everything else is read-only.
