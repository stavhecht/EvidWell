/**
 * The review screen: editor and evidence side by side.
 *
 * This is where invariant #1 is actually exercised — the one place in the
 * product where a human decides something goes live. Three things it must
 * never do:
 *
 *   - Offer Approve on anything that is not `pending_review`. The server
 *     enforces this, but showing a button that always 409s trains reviewers to
 *     ignore errors.
 *   - Approve with unsaved edits in flight. Autosave is flushed first, or the
 *     published article is a stale copy of what the reviewer read.
 *   - Collapse a 409 into a generic failure. The detail names which citation
 *     broke, and that is the whole difference between an actionable error and
 *     a scavenger hunt.
 *
 * The layout is the page scrolling with the evidence column pinned, rather than
 * two independently scrolling panes. Side by side is the requirement — the
 * reviewer cross-checks one against the other continuously, and a tabbed layout
 * turns every check into a context switch — but a pinned column gets that
 * without trapping the wheel in whichever pane the cursor happens to be over.
 *
 * The decision controls sit at the bottom of that column, under the evidence
 * they follow from. Putting Approve in the top bar, which is the reflex, places
 * it where a reviewer's hand rests *before* they have read anything.
