/**
 * Regenerating an article's generated pictures — either of them, or both.
 *
 * An article has two: the `lead` in its body, and the portrait `cover` that
 * only ever appears on the feed tile. They are seen in different places and
 * judged separately, so this hook exposes three targets rather than one button.
 * `picture` and `tile` cost one render each; `both` costs two and gives a pair
 * drawn from one seed.
 *
 * The server draws them and records them on the article, then hands both back.
 * **It does not touch the document** — `original_content` is trigger-protected
 * and `edited_content` is this editor's live buffer, so a server-side rewrite
 * would either fail or clobber whatever the reviewer is typing. The swap
 * happens here instead, which has a second benefit: the new `src` reaches the
 * server through the ordinary autosave, so it passes the same media check as
 * any other edit.
 *
 * The existing node's `width` and `align` are preserved. A reviewer who sized
 * and wrapped a picture was making a layout decision about the article, not
 * about that particular render, and resetting it on every press would make the
 * button feel destructive.
 *
 * If the document has no picture — the reviewer deleted it, or the pipeline
 * never made one — the new lead is inserted at the top rather than refused.
 * That is also what re-pairs the tile: the cover is only used while the
 * document's first image is the lead it was drawn beside.
