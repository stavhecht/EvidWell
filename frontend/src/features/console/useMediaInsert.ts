/**
 * Putting a picture or a video into the draft.
 *
 * Three ways in, one path through: the toolbar's Image button, a paste, and a
 * drop all end at `insertFiles`, which uploads the bytes and inserts a node
 * pointing at what the server stored. Nothing here ever puts a link to someone
 * else's server into the document — see `lib/media.ts` for why that is the
 * rule rather than a preference.
 *
 * The editor arrives after this hook does (`useEditor` needs the paste and drop
 * handlers at construction, and those handlers need to insert), so the editor
 * is held in a ref and `bind` closes the loop. The alternative is putting the
 * upload logic inside the `useEditor` options object, where it re-runs on every
 * render and cannot hold state.
 *
 * Failures are reported, never swallowed. An upload that fails silently looks
 * exactly like a slow one, and the reviewer's next move is to try again — which
 * is the one thing that cannot help.
