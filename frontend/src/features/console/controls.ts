 * The console's three control styles, in one place.

 * reject-shaped button, and when those drift the console stops teaching which
 * action is which. Consistency here is a safety property, not tidiness — this
 * is the surface where one button publishes.
 *
 * They carry the You.th shapes — pill actions, rounded fields — for the same
 * reason. The desk is a different surface from the public site and says so
 * through its chrome, not by being built out of different parts: a reviewer who
 * has to relearn what a button looks like when they cross between the two is
 * being asked to pay attention to the wrong thing.
