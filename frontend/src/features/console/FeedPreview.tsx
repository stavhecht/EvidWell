/**
 * How this draft will look on the feed — the real tile, among real neighbours.
 *
 * Two decisions carry the whole component.
 *
 * **It renders the public feed's own `ArticleCard`, not a copy of it.** A
 * console-local tile would be a second definition of a tile, free to drift from
 * the one that ships, and a preview that drifts from what publishes is worse
 * than no preview — it is reassuring instead of useful. The card's data comes
 * from `GET /console/articles/:id/card`, which runs the same `derive_card()`
 * the publish path runs, so neither half is a reimplementation.
 *
 * The import direction is console → feed. `App.tsx`'s rule is that *public*
 * routes must never import from `features/console`; this is the other way, and
 * it is the direction that makes the preview honest. Every hook `ArticleCard`
 * needs resolves here: `App.tsx` wraps both route groups in
 * `ReaderAuthProvider > AuthProvider > ToastProvider`, and `main.tsx` mounts
 * `QueryClientProvider > BrowserRouter` above everything.
 *
 * **Neighbours come from the live feed.** Scale is comparative. Whether a
 * headline survives three lines of clamp, whether a picture reads at 190px,
 * whether the verdict kicker holds against a photograph — none of that is
 * answerable from a tile on its own, which is why this is an overlay showing a
 * few cells of the real grid rather than a swatch in the sidebar.
 *
 * Every tile is `inert`. `ArticleCard` renders a live Save control and wraps
 * itself in a link to `/a/{slug}` that resolves to nothing until the draft is
 * published, and a preview must not be pressable into either.
 *
 * **The one live control is Redraw tile**, and it is here rather than in the
 * editor's toolbar because this is the only screen where its effect is visible.
 * A button that spends money and changes nothing you can see is a button
 * reviewers press twice. It redraws the cover alone — the article's own picture
 * is untouched, which is the entire point of the two being separable.
