/**
 * The review desk's own bar.
 *
 * Deliberately not the public `SiteHeader`, and the differences are the point
 * rather than styling: no search over published articles, no account avatar, no
 * category drawer, and a wordmark that says which surface you are on. A reviewer
 * who cannot tell the queue from the site is a reviewer who can mistake a draft
 * for something readers can already see.
 *
 * The one link out is to the public feed, so a reviewer can check what they just
 * published — that direction is safe. The public site carries no link back.
