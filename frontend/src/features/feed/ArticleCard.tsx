/**
 * One tile in the masonry feed.
 *
 * Every field here is derived server-side from the approved article
 * (services/card.py) — there is no card-specific model output, and the picture
 * is the article's own first image rather than a separately-chosen thumbnail.
 * That is what guarantees a tile cannot promise something the article walks
 * back.
 *
 * **The verdict stays on the tile.** The comp's tile carries a category kicker
 * and a headline and nothing else, and that is the one place this
 * implementation departs from it: a feed of health claims where the judgment is
 * only visible after a click is a feed that has made the click the point. The
 * kicker line therefore reads `SUPPORTED · Topical`, with the verdict's scope
 * limit under it and the headline last — the same reading order the previous
 * design used, and the same honest half first.
