/**
 * Names for the public feed's styling — hero, tiles, the article page and its
 * source list.
 *
 * Grouped by surface, in reading order, so this file can be scanned the way the
 * product is read rather than the way the components happen to be split.
 *
 * Three things worth knowing before editing:
 *
 * - **The measures are arguments.** `max-w-article` (800px) on the article page
 *   and 520px on its prose are not arbitrary — they are what make the body read
 *   as an article rather than as a page. Changing either changes the voice, not
 *   just the layout.
 *
 *   They were 760px and `max-w-[64ch]`, sized for a body of three short beats.
 *   Articles now carry subheads and several sections, so the column widened —
 *   but the body reads wider because the *type* grew with it, not because the
 *   column alone did; see PROSE_MEASURE for the measurement that forced that.
 *   `max-w-prose` still exists at 760px and still frames the short public
 *   pages — see `tailwind.config.ts`.
 * - **`shadow-panel` and `shadow-pop` are the only shadows in the system.** Both
 *   belong to things that float over the page. Nothing resting on the page gets
 *   one; the tiles use radius and a scrim instead.
 * - **Tile text is white, not ink.** It sits over a photograph nobody controls,
 *   so it is the one place in the product where a fixed colour beats a token —
 *   see `.ew-tile-scrim` in `styles/youth.css`.

/**
 * The body column: **600px, which is ~89 characters a line** at `text-prose`
 * (20px Instrument Serif).
 *
 * The character count is measured, not estimated, and measuring it is what
 * decided the size of the type. Instrument Serif averages **5.71px a character
 * at 17px** — run the font's advance widths over a paragraph of real article
 * prose and divide. That is ~0.34em, far narrower than a text serif, because it
 * is a display face doing a body job. Two numbers in this file were wrong
 * because nobody had run that:
 *
 *   - `max-w-[64ch]` rendered as 441px, ~77 characters. `ch` is the width of
 *     the *wrapper's* zero and the wrapper inherits 15px while the paragraphs
 *     are larger, so the unit was measuring the wrong font.
 *   - 520px was then written down as "~82 characters, the top of the
 *     comfortable range". It was ~91 — already past it.
 *
 * So the column could not simply be widened again: at 17px, a 600px column is
 * 105 characters and a 640px one is 112. The type had to grow with it.
 * `text-prose` is 20px for that reason, which puts 600px at ~89 characters —
 * long, and deliberately at the far end rather than the middle. A count that
 * reads as "comfortable" in a face this condensed renders as a ribbon of text
 * in a wide box, which is the complaint this replaced.
 *
 * Anyone retuning this: the relationship is `chars ≈ 2.98 × width ÷ size`. Move
 * one and the other has to follow, or the measure silently goes long.
 *
 * `flow-root` contains the floats a reviewer may have placed; without it a
 * picture floated beside the last paragraph hangs below the prose and over the
 * disclaimer.
