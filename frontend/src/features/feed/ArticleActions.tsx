/**
 * Save to a folder, and share.
 *
 * The folder picker is a native `<select>` restyled as a pill rather than a
 * custom listbox. It is a short list of short strings on a page where nothing
 * else is a dropdown, and the native control brings keyboard handling, mobile
 * pickers and a typeahead that a bespoke one would have to reimplement to be as
 * good.
 *
 * Signed out, the controls stay and become the prompt: saving is the main
 * reason to have an account here, and hiding the button removes the one place
 * where that reason is obvious.
