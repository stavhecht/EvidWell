/**
 * "Read more on this" — three articles under the one just read.
 *
 * Same subject first, then anything else, which is the comp's ordering and is
 * also the honest one: these are *related*, not recommended. Nothing here is
 * personalised and nothing is ranked by engagement — it is a subject match and
 * recency, and the standfirst says so.
 *
 * Reuses the feed query rather than adding a related-articles endpoint. The
 * first page is already cached from the feed the reader arrived through, so in
 * the common case this row costs no request at all; when it does fetch, it
 * fetches the same page the back button would have shown anyway.
