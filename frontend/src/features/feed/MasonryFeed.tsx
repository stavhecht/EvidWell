/**
 * The public masonry grid.
 *
 * Virtualised with `masonic`, which only renders tiles near the viewport. That
 * matters more here than in a typical grid: this feed is designed to grow
 * indefinitely and tiles are variable-height by design (see `tileRatio`), so an
 * unvirtualised list degrades on exactly the axis the product is meant to scale
 * on.
 *
 * The design comp lays the feed out with plain CSS `column-count`, which is the
 * simpler mechanism and produces the same picture — but CSS columns render every
 * tile in the document, so it is the one part of the comp not carried over
 * literally. The measurements are: ~190px columns, 14px gutter, which lands at
 * six columns on the 1240px measure and reflows down to two on a phone.
 *
 * Note for a future Next.js port (DESIGN.md §3.1): `masonic` measures DOM
 * nodes, so it is client-only. It would need `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })`
 * with a static grid as the server-rendered fallback — which is also the better
 * mobile layout, so the fallback is not wasted work.
