/**
 * The feed's narrowing, read from and written to the URL.
 *
 * One module owns the parameter names, so the header that writes `?q=` and the
 * feed that reads it cannot drift apart — the failure mode being a search box
 * that appears to do nothing.
 *
 * Everything here lives in the query string rather than in React state because
 * all of it is worth bookmarking, sharing and reaching with the back button.
 * The drawer's open/closed deliberately does not — it is ephemeral UI state
 * nobody wants a history entry for, so `SiteHeader` keeps it in a `useState`
 * and passes it down. Putting it in this hook would give every caller its own
 * disconnected copy.
 *
 *   ?q=          free text, matched client-side over what has loaded
 *   ?verdict=    server-side filter
 *   ?subject=    server-side filter
 *   ?plain=1     turn off a signed-in reader's interest ordering
