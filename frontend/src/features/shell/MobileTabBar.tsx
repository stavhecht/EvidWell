/**
 * The bottom tab bar, below `sm` only.
 *
 * The top bar keeps the wordmark, search and the theme toggle at every width;
 * what it cannot keep on a phone is the nav cluster, which is why About and the
 * account collapse to icons up there and reappear as labelled tabs down here.
 * Four tabs, matching the comp: Feed, Categories, Saved, You.
 *
 * "Categories" opens the drawer rather than navigating, so it is a `<button>`
 * among links. That asymmetry is deliberate and is why the drawer state is
 * duplicated here rather than lifted: two independent triggers for one panel is
 * simpler than one panel with two owners, and the panel itself is stateless.
