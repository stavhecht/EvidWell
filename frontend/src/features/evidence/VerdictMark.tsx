/**
 * The verdict mark — the single most important pixel in the product.
 *
 * It carries the judgment in **geometry, not colour**: a square that is filled,
 * half-filled, quarter-filled or empty. That is a deliberate reversal of the
 * obvious design, and the reasons are the ones that used to be written on the
 * old coloured badge:
 *
 * 1. **Never colour-only.** A verdict conveyed by hue fails silently for
 *    colour-blind readers and in greyscale screenshots — and this product gets
 *    screenshotted into arguments. Geometry survives both, and the text label
 *    still rides alongside it in every usage.
 * 2. **`no_evidence` is neutral, not alarming.** "We looked and found nothing"
 *    is an honest, useful result. It is an empty square drawn in the same ink
 *    family as the rest — a gap in the literature, not a warning.
 * 3. **A green/amber/red ramp turns the feed into a scoreboard.** Ranking
 *    products by hue is the thing the content rules forbid, and a grid of
 *    traffic lights does it whatever the copy says. Freeing the colour axis is
 *    what lets `subject` colour exist at all (see `./subject.ts`).
 *
 * The fill fraction is not decorative either — it reads as "how much of the
 * claim is supported", which is exactly what `mixed` and `weak` mean.
