/**
 * The evidence grade — eight rungs, weakest first, filled to the strongest
 * study type actually retrieved.
 *
 * This is the *warrant* for the verdict, and it is a separate signal on purpose:
 * "Supported" backed by a meta-analysis and "Supported" backed by one small RCT
 * are different claims, and a reader who can only see the verdict cannot tell
 * them apart. Server-side this same ordering caps how confident a verdict is
 * allowed to be (invariant #3, `evidence/grading.py`); showing the bar is what
 * makes that cap legible rather than mysterious.
 *
 * Filled segments are ink and unfilled are the hairline rule — no colour here
 * either, for the reasons in VerdictMark.tsx.
