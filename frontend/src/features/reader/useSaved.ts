/**
 * The Save control's state and its two mutations.
 *
 * One query for a whole page of tiles, not one per tile: `/readers/saved/slugs`
 * returns `{ slug: folderId }` for everything on the shelf, which is a
 * human-sized list by construction. A per-card query would be forty requests
 * for a feed of forty and would refetch all of them on every toggle.
 *
 * Signed out, `isSaved` is always false and `toggle` reports what is missing
 * rather than failing. Saving is the main reason to have an account, so the
 * control stays visible and becomes the prompt — hiding it would remove the
 * one place the reason for signing up is obvious.
