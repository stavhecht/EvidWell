 * Every value here resolves to a design-system custom property rather than a

 * theme — including the light/dark flip — is decided entirely in
 * `src/styles/youth.css`. A hex in a component is a bug: it cannot follow the
 * theme, and it is invisible to anyone retuning the system.
 *
 * The old `verdict.*` ramp (green / amber / orange / stone) is deliberately
 * gone. The design direction takes verdict off the colour axis entirely and
 * carries it in geometry instead — see `features/evidence/VerdictMark.tsx`.
 * Colour now means *subject*, never judgment.
 *
 * The consequence to know about: colours defined as `var(...)` do not support
 * Tailwind's slash-opacity syntax (`text-ink/50` will not work). That is
 * intentional pressure toward the four-step ink ramp, which hits its contrast
 * ratios predictably on both grounds where a faded ink does not.
