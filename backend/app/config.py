    discovery_window_days: int = 14
    #: Days each scan re-reads *before* its window start. MeSH indexing lands
    #: days to weeks after a record enters PubMed, so a record inside last
    #: window's dates only becomes visible during this one. Re-reading is free —
    #: observations conflict to a no-op — and the only cost is API calls. Set it
    #: too small and every scan under-counts the newest half of its own window,
    #: which is exactly the half a trend detector exists to see.
    discovery_overlap_days: int = 21

    #: enough that a year-old wave stops reading as new.
    discovery_baseline_windows: int = 6
    #: Windows of history required before *any* candidate is emitted. Below
    #: this the scan writes observations and proposes nothing. A first scan with
    #: no baseline can only rank by raw volume, which floods the desk with
    #: vitamin D and creatine — the three things a reviewer would have named
    #: unaided, arriving with the authority of a ranking. There is deliberately
    #: no volume fallback; build the baseline with
    #: `python -m scripts.scan_trends --bootstrap --apply`.
    discovery_min_baseline_windows: int = 4
    #: Papers in the window before a substance can be proposed. Three is one lab
    #: publishing a series; four is where "several groups" starts.
    #:
    #: Lowered 4 -> 3 on 2026-09-07 because four was starving the desk, measured
    #: rather than guessed. Over a live 14-day window the substance counts ran
    #: 9, 5, 5, 4, then 3, 3, 3, 3, then a long tail at 2 and 1 — so a floor of
    #: four admitted **four substances in the whole corpus** and a floor of three
    #: admits eight. With three of those already promoted the desk had nothing
    #: left to offer, which reads as a broken scan rather than a strict one.
    #:
    #: The cost is smaller than it looks, because this floor is about *trend
    #: detection*, not about how much evidence an article gets. A substance is
    #: proposed on its recent publishing rate; the article it becomes retrieves
    #: independently across all of PubMed (`retrieval_top_k` per claim), so a
    #: substance with three recent papers can still rest on twenty-year-old
    #: systematic reviews. Thin *recent* interest is also already priced in by
    #: the scorer's `log2(1 + n)` term rather than only by this gate.
    #:
    #: Do not read it down to 2: that admits 24 more substances at once, which
    #: is a ranking over noise.
    discovery_min_papers: int = 3
    #: Angles one scan may propose for a single substance. A substance surges as
    #: a whole and gets written about one question at a time — "omega-3 for
    #: muscle recovery" and "omega-3 for skin" are different articles resting on
    #: different papers. Without a cap a single surge takes every slot on the
    #: desk, which is the opposite of the variety the ranking exists to provide;
    #: with a cap of 1 the other angles are never offered at all. Two is a desk
    #: that can show eight substances or four, not one.
    discovery_max_angles_per_substance: int = 2
    #: How far back to look when deciding *which questions* a substance is
    #: studied for. Much wider than the trend window on purpose — they are
    #: different questions with different timescales. "Is omega-3 surging?" is a
    #: fortnight's question; "what is omega-3 studied for?" is a slow fact.
    #: Measured 2026-09-06: a 21-day window produced four usable angles across
    #: the whole corpus; sixty days produced caffeine against strength,
    #: endurance, cognition and heart rate. Costs nothing — it reads the
    #: observation ledger, not PubMed.
    discovery_angle_lookback_days: int = 90
    #: Papers backing a *single angle* before it is worth proposing separately.
    #: A different question from `discovery_min_papers`: that floor asks whether
    #: the substance is moving, this one asks whether there is enough to write a
    #: specific piece. Measured 2026-09-06 — omega-3 had 8 papers over 55 outcome
    #: descriptors, so an angle floor set at the *then* substance floor of 4
    #: would have collapsed every substance back to one angle.
    #:
    #: It sat below the substance floor until 2026-09-07, when that floor came
    #: down to 3 and the two became equal. Left at 3 rather than dropped to 2:
    #: two co-occurring papers is too thin to name an article's specific subject,
    #: and equality is not the no-op the old note warned about — it only means a
    #: substance at exactly the floor needs *all* its papers on one outcome to
    #: earn an angle. Everything else falls back to a bare topic, which is what
    #: `polyphenols` and `triterpenes` did on the first scan after the change.
    #: **Never set it above `discovery_min_papers`**: that is unreachable by
    #: construction, and every angle would silently become a bare topic.
    discovery_min_papers_per_angle: int = 3
    #: Descriptors appearing in more than this share of a scan's records are
    #: stoplisted automatically, whatever `discovery/vocab.py` says. MeSH has
    #: ~30,000 descriptors and check tags change between editions, so a hand
    #: list will always be missing something — and what it misses is always the
    #: same shape: a term on most of the corpus, which by construction cannot
    #: distinguish any part of it.
    discovery_document_frequency_ceiling: float = 0.35
    #: Candidates one scan may propose, and so the most the desk ever holds —
    #: `expire_absent` retires anything this scan did not re-rank, so the desk is
    #: exactly the last scan's list.
    #:
    #: This is the reviewer-flooding control: it is literally the number of
    #: "spend money" buttons on the screen. Six rather than eight by request.
    #:
    #: **It is a ceiling and has never been the reason the desk looks empty.**
    #: `rank_candidates` is asked for `limit * 3` precisely so suppression can
    #: remove already-decided topics without shrinking the desk — the next-best
    #: candidates are pulled up automatically. When the desk shows three, the
    #: binding constraint is `discovery_min_papers`, not this. Check the dry
    #: run's "N of M above the floor" line before raising it.
    discovery_max_candidates: int = 6

    #: How long a dismissed candidate stays suppressed. Half a year, because a

    #:
    #: Daily against a 14-day window is deliberate over-sampling: MeSH indexing

    #: (90); nothing reads further back, so a succeeded scan deletes older rows.
