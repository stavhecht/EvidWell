"""Shared base for every API response model.

The wire format is **camelCase**; Python stays snake_case. Without this the
TypeScript client would have to either mirror Python naming or remap every
field by hand, and hand-remapping is where silent contract drift starts.

``populate_by_name=True`` means handlers can still construct these with Python
field names — ``ArticleOut(**service_dict)`` works with the snake_case dicts
the service layer returns, and only serialisation is camelCased.

#: An email address on the wire.

#: A shape check, not ``pydantic.EmailStr``. The full validator pulls in
#: ``email-validator`` and its DNS-adjacent rules to reject addresses that are
#: technically legal, which buys nothing here: the only thing this system does
#: with an address is send to it, and delivery is the real test either way.
#: What the constraint does buy is a normalised value — trimmed and lowercased
#: before it reaches the unique index — so `Ada@Example.com` and
#: `ada@example.com ` cannot become two accounts.
#:
#: 254 is the RFC 5321 ceiling on a full address.
