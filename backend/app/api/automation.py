"""Machine-to-machine endpoints for n8n. Shared-secret auth, router-level.

n8n owns *when* a research run happens (its weekly schedule, or its manual
webhook); this router lets it start one and poll it. It calls the same
``start_run`` the desk's button does — the research logic lives in
``app/research`` and nowhere in n8n.

Authentication is a static token in ``X-Trigger-Token``, compared in constant
time. **With ``RESEARCH_TRIGGER_TOKEN`` unset the whole router answers 404**,
so a deployment that does not use n8n exposes nothing here. The token cannot
reach reviewer or reader routes: those check their own bearer JWTs, and this
dependency is attached to this router only.

What the token grants is deliberately small: starting a research run (which
proposes and never enqueues generation) and reading research runs. No article,
reviewer or reader data is reachable with it.
