"""Editorial console endpoints. JWT required on every route.

Auth is applied at the router level (``dependencies=[Depends(require_reviewer)]``)
rather than per-handler. A per-handler decorator is one forgotten line away
from an unauthenticated console endpoint; a router-level dependency cannot be
forgotten by adding a route.

Two deliberate omissions from this surface:

* **No DELETE on articles.** Rejection is a state, and the audit trail is the
  product.
* **No endpoint that sets status directly.** ``approve`` and ``reject`` are the
  only transitions, and ``approve`` is the only path to ``published`` anywhere
  in the system.

    likes the picture in the prose and not the one on the tile would otherwise
    have to give up the first to fix the second, and pay twice to do it.

    The one console action that bills an external provider per press, which is
    why it is the one with a spend budget in front of it. The budget is checked
    **before** the render for the same reason ``login_throttle`` is checked
    before the Argon2 hash: a limit applied after the expensive part protects
    nothing. It counts renders, so a one-frame press costs half a two-frame one.

    Uses the article's ``subject`` when a reviewer has set one, so pressing
    this after classifying a draft genuinely produces a better-composed picture
    than the pipeline could — the pipeline runs before the article row exists
    and has no subject to read.

    **Does not touch the document.** The response carries both frames and the
    console swaps the editor's image node itself, so the new ``src`` reaches
    ``edited_content`` through autosave and its media check. See
    ``ReviewService.set_illustration``.
