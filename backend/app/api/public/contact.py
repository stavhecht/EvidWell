"""The public half of "Let us know". One route, write-only.

There is no GET here on purpose. Reading the inbox is a console route
(``/api/console/contact``) because the rows carry an email address and free
text written by anyone with the URL.

Rate-limited by IP through the same token-bucket the reader login uses. Without
it this is an open write endpoint on a table with a text column, which is a
spam sink rather than an inbox. The limit rejects rather than sleeps — same
reasoning as ``security/login_throttle.py``: a delay only slows a client that
chooses to wait.
