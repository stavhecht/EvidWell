"""Process-wide logging for the API and the worker, with secrets kept out.

httpx logs every request URL at INFO, and NCBI takes its API key as a query
parameter, so every PubMed call wrote the key into the log in plain text. The
request lines are worth keeping — they are how a throttled or failing provider
is diagnosed — so the key is masked rather than the logger silenced.

The filter sits on the root handlers, not on a logger: a logger's filters do not
see records propagated up from its children, a handler's see everything it
writes.
