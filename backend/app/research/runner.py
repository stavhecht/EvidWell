"""Executes one claimed research run. Called from the pipeline worker's loop.

In the worker, not the API, for the same reason a generation run is: it takes
minutes (Trends pacing and web searches dominate). In the *same* worker as
pipeline runs so the two never overlap — the worker's PubMed throttle is per
process and NCBI's ceiling is per IP, so a research run and a pipeline run
counting papers at the same time would each think it had the whole budget.
The cost is that a queued draft waits for a research run to finish.
