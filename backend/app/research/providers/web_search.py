"""Simple web search, through DuckDuckGo (the ``ddgs`` package). No key, no cost.

A discovery and coverage layer only. Results say what is being written about a
topic and by whom — they are never evidence for a health claim, and nothing
downstream treats them as such. ``ddgs`` scrapes, so it is slow (~8 s per
search, measured 2026-09-30) and can be throttled; the graph therefore only
web-searches the candidates still in contention (``research_web_pool_size``).

ddgs is synchronous; calls run in a thread, one at a time.
