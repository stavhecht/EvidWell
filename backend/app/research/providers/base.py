"""One protocol per kind of signal. The graph depends on these, never on a library.

Swapping Google Trends for another trend source, DuckDuckGo for a paid search
API, or News API for GDELT is a new class here and a line in
``research/factory.py`` — nothing in ``graph.py`` changes.

**Every provider raises ``ProviderUnavailable`` rather than returning an empty
result when it could not answer.** An empty list means "asked, and there was
nothing"; the graph records a failure differently, and never scores it as zero.
Same principle as ``retrieval/throttle.py``: a search that could not run must
never look like one that found nothing.
