"""Rank one claim's candidate papers, then number them S1..Sn for the article.

    score = best chunk similarity + grade bonus + recency bonus

Similarity alone answers "is this paper about the claim?", not "is it good
evidence?". A cell-culture study written in the claim's own words would beat a
systematic review written clinically, so stronger study designs get a bonus.
The bonus sizes are starting values to tune against real output, not settled
numbers.

        * **Top-k is cut in Python, after the bonuses.** A SQL ``LIMIT`` on
