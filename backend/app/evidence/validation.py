"""Citation validation — the gate between generation and the review queue.

This module is where invariant #2 stops being a prompt instruction and becomes
a fact. It runs after every synthesis call, before persistence, and it decides
whether a draft is allowed to exist as ``pending_review``.

The design rule it embodies: **the thing that generates must not be the thing
that approves.** Nothing here consults the model, and nothing here trusts the
model's own account of what it cited. Checks run against (a) the exact handle
set that was rendered into the prompt and (b) the database. Neither is
influenceable by generation.

A draft that fails is stored as ``validation_failed`` with a structured report
and never enters the queue. It is not silently dropped — a persistent
validation failure is a prompt bug, and the console surfaces these on their own
tab so the bug is visible rather than absent.

    Computed over the **cited** sources only. Sources the model retrieved but
    ignored cannot raise its ceiling — otherwise a strong review sitting unused
    in the prompt would license a confident verdict the article never actually
    supported.

    Two questions, not one. *How good* is the evidence, which is the study-type
    ceiling; and *how much of it is there*, which is the quorum. A lone trial
    answers the first perfectly well and the second not at all, and the first
    version of this check only asked the first — so one cited study could carry
    ``supported``, the strongest thing this system can say. Both are evaluated
    **per claim**, and the article inherits its weakest claim's ceiling.

    **The ceiling is returned whether or not it was exceeded**, because the
    check is one-sided: it can only fail a verdict that is too strong. A verdict
    below its ceiling is either an honest cautious call or a model declining to
    commit, and nothing here can tell them apart — so the number is recorded and
    the judgement left to the reviewer, who can see both.

    The returned ``StudyType`` is still the best grade cited anywhere in the
    article: it is stored on the row as a description of the evidence and shown
    in the console, and it stays a fact about the sources rather than becoming
    a verdict-shaped judgement. The quorum shows up in the *ceiling*, which is
    why the failure message reports both.

    This is what makes "honest about evidence strength" structural. A
    ``supported`` verdict resting on two cell-culture studies fails here and the
    draft never reaches a human. It is not a style note and it is not
