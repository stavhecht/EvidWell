"""Evidence-quality grading, and the verdict ceiling it implies.

Hierarchy (weakest → strongest):
    in-vitro / animal < observational < RCT < systematic review / meta-analysis

Two jobs:

1. **Classify** a paper into a ``StudyType`` from whatever metadata the
   provider gave us. Best-effort, and biased toward under-claiming.
2. **Cap** verdict confidence by the strongest evidence actually cited. This is
   invariant #3 and it is not advisory — a verdict above its cap is a
   validation failure that keeps the draft out of the review queue.

The small pure functions here are implemented rather than stubbed: they *are*
the specification of the invariant, and expressing them as prose in a docstring
would leave the most important rule in the system as the least precise thing in
it.

#: "Review" is a supertype, not a verdict — it says a paper reviews a

#: for ``NARRATIVE_REVIEW`` was tried and reverted: PubMed's indexing lags, and
#: several genuine systematic reviews in the cache carry only this tag while
#: their *titles* say "A Systematic Review". Mapping it suppressed the text
#: fallback and demoted them — the same failure as the protocol bug, mirrored.
#:
#: So it is a **floor**: narrative review unless the text says otherwise, and
#: the text may only raise it within the review family below. Never to RCT — a
#: narrative review's abstract discusses randomised trials at length, which is

#: exactly like "no metadata at all", so a paper tagged ``Clinical Trial

#: randomised trial it intends to run*, in those words. Three of them scored
#: RCT, whose ceiling is ``supported``, on the strength of a study that has not
#: reported a single result.
#:
#: The same mechanism promoted a plainly-tagged ``Review`` to
#: ``systematic_review``, because a review discusses the randomised trials it
#: surveys. One such paper was cited in a real draft and set its evidence
#: grade. The docstring on ``classify_study_type`` promises to prefer the
