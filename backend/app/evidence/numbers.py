"""A number written beside a citation must be in the source it cites.

The commonest grounding failure the evaluation found was not invention but
attribution: a real statistic from one source, cited to another. Measured
2026-10-01 over 113 articles, 14% quoted such a number, and 71 of 76 flagged
numbers appeared in a different source the model had been shown — "effect size
0.26 (0.15 to 0.38) [S8]" where the figures are S7's. The handle exists, so
the existing checks pass the draft, and the reader is sent to a paper that does
not say what the sentence says.

So: every sentence that cites something is read for its numbers, and each must
appear — exactly, or as a rounding — in the title, year, abstract or full-text
excerpts of the sources that sentence cites. That is exactly the text the model
was shown for them. Two things are not checked:

* **Counts of the sources themselves** ("three trials", "2 meta-analyses"): the
  model counting its citations, not quoting a paper.
* **Uncited sentences**, which have no source to check against. Whether a
  finding *should* be cited is the cited-beat rule's question, not this one's.

A failure names the numbers, the handles, and — when it can — which source does
contain them, because that is the fix: re-cite, not rewrite.
