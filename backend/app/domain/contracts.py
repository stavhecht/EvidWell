This module is the spec. If a stage's input or output isn't described here, it

#: three sources writes ``[S1, S5, S8]``, and rejecting that cost a whole draft:
#: the body failed to parse, the article was written ``validation_failed``, and
#: it never reached the review queue.

#: **This is the only definition of a marker, and tiptap.py builds on it.** The
#: parser and the handle extractor disagreeing is worse than either being
#: strict: handles inside a marker the extractor cannot read are absent from
#: ``ArticleBody.cited_handles()``, so ``was_cited`` is false for sources the article
