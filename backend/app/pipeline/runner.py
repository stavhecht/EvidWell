"""The local pipeline worker.

A separate process that polls ``pipeline_runs`` for queued work and drives the
orchestrator. Separate from the API process on purpose: a generation run takes
minutes, and a request-scoped background task ties that lifetime to a web
worker that may be recycled mid-run.

Production path (DESIGN.md §10): this file goes away. EventBridge triggers a
Step Functions execution, each stage becomes a Lambda, and the polling loop
becomes the state machine. The orchestrator and the stages are unchanged —
only this dispatch shell is local-only.

Run with:  python -m app.pipeline.runner
