#: Fraction of the offered sources a draft must give a citation of their own
#: (see ``MAX_HANDLES_PER_CITATION``) before it is left alone. Below this it is
#: re-prompted once, naming the handles it skipped.
#:
#: **This is not a length rule, and it deliberately stopped being one.** It was
#: briefly a word-count floor aimed at a three-minute read, which was the wrong
#: target twice over: it fired on essentially every run because no local model
#: this machine can hold writes 700 words, and length was never the defect
#: anyway. The defect is a draft that was handed 24 systematic reviews and wrote
#: about three of them — measured, repeatedly — and the one re-prompt that
#: clearly worked took a draft from 3 cited sources to 24.
#:
#: Aiming at coverage instead keeps DESIGN.md §6 intact rather than bending it:
#: there is no floor on how long an article may be, and a thoroughly-cited short
#: article is now a correct output that is never re-prompted. It also restates a
#: rule the synthesis prompt already gives — "every source bearing on a claim
#: deserves a sentence" — rather than adding a competing one.
#:
#: Raised 0.5 -> 0.75 on 2026-09-29, together with counting own citations
#: rather than handles. Against the twelve articles in the database the old
#: rule let two first drafts through: one citing exactly half its sources, and
#: one that "cited" 22 of 24 by putting 19 handles in one bracket, in 109
#: words. The new rule re-prompts all twelve, so expect it to fire on most runs
#: with ``SECTIONS_EXPECTED_FROM`` or more sources. Each firing is one more
#: synthesis call: free locally, and recorded in the token ledger when hosted.
MIN_CITED_FRACTION = 0.75

#: Most handles one citation may carry and still count toward coverage. A
#: citation is one chip on the page, a run of adjacent markers split by the
#: same ``CITATION_RUN_RE`` the renderer uses, so ``[S1][S2][S3][S4]`` is one
#: citation of four, exactly as a reader sees it.
#:
#: Three because the synthesis prompt's own example of a shared citation is
#: ``[S1, S5, S8]``, and because that is where real drafts sit: of the 57
#: citations in the database on 2026-09-29, 54 carried one to three handles
#: and the other three carried 5, 5 and 19. A long list after one sentence says
#: nothing about what any of those sources found, which is the thing the
#: re-prompt exists to ask for.
#:
#: This decides only what the nudge counts. ``cited_handles()``, ``was_cited``
#: and validation still count every handle anywhere in the body.
MAX_HANDLES_PER_CITATION = 3

#: Sources below which a thinly-cited draft is left alone. The prompt already
#: says "six or more usable sources supports 3 to 5 sections"; reusing its number
#: keeps this a nudge toward a rule the model was given.
#:
#: This is the anti-padding guarantee. A draft citing one of two sources has
#: nothing more to say, and asking it for more can only invent it. Only a draft
#: sitting on plenty of unused evidence is worth a second ask.
