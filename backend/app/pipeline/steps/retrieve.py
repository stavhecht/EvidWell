"""Stage 2 — search the scholarly APIs for every claim and cache the results.

For each claim:
  1. Build the queries (``retrieval/query_builder.py``).
  2. Run every query against every provider in parallel.
  3. Drop trial protocols and retracted papers.
Then, across all claims:
  4. Merge duplicate papers (``retrieval/dedup.py``).
  5. Fill in the PMID of any paper that arrived with only a DOI, when Europe
     PMC knows one (``retrieval/identifiers.py``), and merge again.
  6. Ask PubMed whether any paper a non-PubMed provider supplied has been
     retracted, and drop it if so.
  7. Save them to the cache and embed new abstracts in chunks
     (``retrieval/cache.py``).

A search that two claims share — the same terms, the same pass — runs once
and both claims get its answer. Claims often reduce to identical queries
("increases muscle power" and "improves muscle mass" both keep only the
muscle hint), and each duplicate spent NCBI requests and OpenAlex credits for
an answer already in hand.

Three outcomes for a claim, deliberately kept apart:

* **Searched, found nothing.** Fine. The article can honestly say "no evidence".
* **Every provider call failed.** The stage fails (retryable). Otherwise a
  throttled search would reach synthesis as the same empty list as a real
  "nothing found", and publish a confident verdict nobody checked.
* **The query names no substance.** The stage fails (not retryable). An
  outcome-only query returns real but off-topic papers, and every later
  stage would read that as success.
