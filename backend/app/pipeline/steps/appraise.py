"""Stage 5 — label which way each ranked source points, per claim.

The verdict scale measures support, and the verdict cap counts a cited source
toward a claim by what it was *retrieved for*, never by what it *found*. So a
trial that tested a claim and found nothing looked, to every check downstream,
exactly like one that bore it out. Retrieval already brings such trials back —
queries are ``<substance> AND <outcome>`` with the directional verbs dropped —
and until this stage nothing recorded which way they pointed.

Each (source, claim) pair gets a ``Stance`` on ``ctx.stances``, under the same
S-handles RANK assigned. SYNTHESIZE copies them onto the prompt payload for
VALIDATE to read, and PERSIST writes them to ``article_sources.stance``.

**Two modes, chosen by ``APPRAISAL_MODE``; both put relevance before direction.**

* ``one_call`` (default): one call per claim. The model names the claim's
  outcome, quotes each abstract's sentence about it (or "none"), and labels the
  quote; ``label`` stores ``off_topic`` where there is no quote.
* ``two_call``: a relevance call over every source, then a direction call shown
  only the sources it accepted, so a study of something else is never asked for
  a direction. A claim with nothing relevant skips the second call.

Measured 2026-10-02 on llama3.1:8b over 132 blind-labelled pairs, the two were
level on flips (2 each, on different studies) and ``one_call`` was slightly
ahead on direction (79% against 78%) and on off-topic studies caught (75%
against 69%) at one call instead of two — the full table is in CLAUDE.md. Both
are kept because the winner is a fact about a model, not about the task: a
larger or hosted model may reverse it, and re-measuring is a setting away.

**The synthesis model is not shown these labels**, deliberately: two
independent readings of the same abstracts are what make a disagreement
visible. Today a label changes nothing but a reviewer warning; whether it ever
gates a verdict is decided from what the evaluation measures of its accuracy.

**This stage never fails a run**, like FULL_TEXT and ILLUSTRATE. Without labels
the article is drafted and validated exactly as before the stage existed, and
``cause`` in the metrics says why there were none. A pair with no label is *not
appraised* — never ``unclear``, which is an answer the model gave.

    """The stance stored for one item. Two rules can overrule the model, and
    both only ever move a label to ``off_topic``:

    * **No quote, no label.** ``off_topic`` whenever the abstract has no
      sentence reporting the claim's outcome, whatever direction the model
      gave. A direction on an off-topic study was the error measured most often
      (2026-10-02, llama3.1:8b: asked for a direction alone, only 23% of
      off-topic studies were called off topic). A quote of "none" counts as no
      quote even when the boolean beside it says otherwise.
    * **A refutation must be about the outcome.** A ``no_effect`` or
      ``contradicts`` label whose quote shares no word with ``claim_outcome`` is
      stored ``off_topic``. Measured on the same day, the commonest directional
      error left was a made-up refutation — 11 of 131 labels — where the model
      quoted a sentence about something else ("increases in strength", for a
      claim about endurance) and called it no effect. An "against" label is the
      one a ``not_supported`` verdict would be built from, so it is the one held
      to the stricter test; ``supports`` is not, because synonyms ("TG" for
      triglycerides) would turn real support into a false off-topic call.

    Measured over the same 132 pairs: made-up refutations 11 -> 6 and flipped
    directions 2 -> 0, at a price — real refutations missed 9 -> 16, because a
    quote like "the pooled RR was 0.96" names no outcome. On an 18-case run it
    removed one of the two false "against" warnings and kept the real catch. A
    prompt rule against the same error ("silence is not a result") was tried
    first and did nothing (12 made-up refutations), so the rule lives here.

    It is a word test, not an understanding of the sentence: a quote that shares
    a word but answers a different question ("muscle strength" against "muscle
    gain") passes — the other false warning was exactly that. It errs toward
    losing a direction, which is the safe way to be wrong here.
