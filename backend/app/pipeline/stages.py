"""Stage contract and the context that flows between stages.

Every stage is ``async (PipelineContext) -> PipelineContext``. Two properties
follow from that shape, and both are deliberate:

* **Serialisable context, no shared memory.** Stages communicate only through
  ``PipelineContext``, which is a Pydantic model. That is what makes the AWS
  migration a transport swap rather than a redesign — each stage becomes a
  Lambda, the context becomes the Step Functions state document, and the
  orchestrator calls Invoke instead of the function. Reach for module-level
  state or a shared client cache inside a stage and that property is gone.

* **Room for the agentic loop without changing any stage.** Query refinement,
  when it arrives, is a loop the orchestrator runs around RETRIEVE and RANK:
  re-run with widened queries while the candidate pool is too thin. No stage
  needs to know it is being re-run. Deferred per the brief; the seam is here so
  it stays cheap.
