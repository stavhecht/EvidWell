"""The stage sequence as a LangGraph state machine.

Split from ``orchestrator.py`` because the two answer different questions. This
file knows *what runs next*; the orchestrator knows *what is committed and what
is recorded*, and that division is the reason the port is safe. Every
transaction boundary, every ``pipeline_stage_runs`` row and every failure path
stays where it was; what moved here is the ``for`` loop that used to decide the
order, and it moved because a loop cannot express the one thing the pipeline now
needs to do that is not a straight line.

**The refinement edge is the whole reason this is a graph.** RANK can tell that
a claim has fewer than ``QUORUM_FOR_SUPPORTED`` supported-tier sources, which
means the article's verdict is already capped by what retrieval found rather
than by what the evidence says. Sending that claim back through RETRIEVE with a
broader query is a cycle, and a cycle is what the old shape could not hold: the
stage list is ordered and each stage runs once. DESIGN.md §5 anticipated exactly
this ("a loop *around* RETRIEVE and RANK") and deferred it.

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to lose:

* **The context is carried by reference, not merged.** ``GraphState`` holds one
  key whose value is the whole ``PipelineContext``, so LangGraph replaces it
  wholesale and never reduces its fields. ``usage_by_stage`` and ``metrics`` are
  mutated in place on purpose — a stage that raises returns no context, and its
  burned tokens would otherwise vanish from exactly the runs whose cost is least
  visible — and a per-field reducer would quietly turn those mutations into
  writes that get dropped on the failure path.
* **Node names are positional.** The pipeline is a list, tests pass lists of one
  stage, and nothing guarantees a given ``StageName`` is present. Keying nodes on
  the enum would make the graph undefined for any list that is not the full
  seven.
