"""The article a topic gets when the literature has nothing to say.

Built in code, never by a model. Every other article in this system earns its
sentences from retrieved abstracts; this one has none, so there is nothing for
a generative call to be grounded in. Handing a model a product name and zero
sources is precisely the ungrounded generation the rest of the pipeline exists
to prevent — and it would arrive carrying no citations, so ``validate_draft``
would have nothing to check and invariant #2 would pass by vacuum rather than
by verification.

So the prose is a template. It says three things and cannot be induced to say a
fourth: what the product claims, that a search found nothing meeting our
evidence criteria, and that absence of research is not a finding against the
product. That last sentence is the one worth being careful about — "no evidence
for" is not "evidence against", and a reader who takes the first for the second
has been misled by an article that was technically accurate.

Reached from two causes that are identical to a reader but not to you (see
``pipeline/steps/synthesize.py``):

* retrieval returned no candidates at all — a genuinely unstudied trend;
* candidates were retrieved but none survived the rank filters (minimum year,
  minimum abstract length, grade floor).

The stage metrics record which, because "science has not studied this" and "our
filters are too tight" need the same sentence to a reader and very different
responses from us.
