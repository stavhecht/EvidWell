"""Feed cards are derived from the article. They are never generated.

There is no card-generation prompt and no card field the model controls
independently. One AI output, two renderings — so the card and the article
cannot contradict each other. A separate generation call is the obvious
alternative and it is exactly the thing that produces a confident card sitting
above a hedged article.

Derivation runs at publish time, from ``COALESCE(edited_content,
original_content)``, so the card reflects what the human approved rather than
what the model first wrote. The result is materialised onto the article row to
keep the feed query a single index scan.

    The rule this function exists to keep true is that a feed tile cannot show
    a picture the article does not contain. A portrait frame held on the

    honest is that both frames were drawn in one step, from one prompt, with
    one seed, for this article, and that the document's first image is still
    the landscape one of the pair.

    The moment a reviewer replaces that picture, deletes it, or places another
    above it, the pair is broken by the only person who could break it, and the
    card falls back to what their document actually shows. Failing toward "no
    cover" rather than "wrong cover" is the whole design.
