        Reads the materialised card columns only — the feed never touches
        article content, which is what keeps it a single index scan
        (``articles_feed_idx``) at any feed size.

        ``interests`` lifts a signed-in reader's subjects to the top **without
        hiding anything**: the sort gains a leading tier — 0 for a subject they
        picked, 1 for everything else — and the rest of the feed follows below
        it. Filtering instead would make an account quietly narrow the world,
        which is the thing a feed of health claims should least do; it also
        means an unclassified article (``subject IS NULL``) is still reachable
        by scrolling rather than invisible to anyone with an interest set.

        The consequence to know: the tiered sort cannot use
        ``articles_feed_idx``, because the leading key is a CASE expression.
        That is affordable while the feed is small and is the reason the tier
        is skipped entirely — same statement as before — for a reader with no
        interests, which is every anonymous request. If personalised paging
