"""Reader accounts: signup, profile, folders, saves.

The public side's counterpart to ``services/review.py``, and deliberately much
smaller. A reader account does three things and no more:

1. **Orders the feed.** Interests lift subjects to the top; nothing is hidden.
   See ``FeedService.page``.
2. **Keeps folders.** A shelf survives the browser, which is the whole reason
   an account exists rather than ``localStorage``.
3. **Records a newsletter opt-in.** A boolean, and nothing that sends anything
   — the sending half is not built, and a column that claims otherwise would
   be worse than an honest one.

What it deliberately cannot do: read a draft, influence what publishes, or see
anything the anonymous feed does not. Invariant #1 is about who decides what
the public sees, and a reader is the public.
