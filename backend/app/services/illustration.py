"""Draw an article's two pictures and put them in the media store.

**One function, two callers, on purpose.** ``IllustrateStage`` calls this
during a pipeline run and the console's regenerate route calls it when a
reviewer presses the button. A second implementation would drift, and the drift
would be a feed tile that no longer matches the article it belongs to — which
is precisely the failure the pairing rule in ``services/card.py`` exists to
prevent, arriving through the back door.

Two renders, one prompt, one seed: landscape for the prose column, portrait for
the feed tile.

**They are two pictures of the same subject in the same style — not one
photograph at two aspect ratios.** That distinction was measured, not assumed,
and it cost a wrong claim in the docs before it was: the same prompt and the
same seed at two sizes produce visibly different compositions, because the
latent noise a seed initialises has the shape of the frame. Worse, on the
provider this actually routes to (`nscale`, through HF's OpenAI-shaped
`/v1/images/generations`), **the seed is ignored outright** — two renders at
identical prompt, size and seed came back different. See ``seed_for_run``.

So what the pairing rule in ``services/card.py`` guarantees is narrower than
"the tile is a crop of the article's picture", and it is still the thing worth
guaranteeing: the tile's picture came from the same generation, for this
article, under the same locked claim-free prompt, and it is discarded the
moment the article's own picture is no longer the one drawn beside it. Neither
frame asserts anything, so neither can assert something the other does not.

If the two ever need to be provably the same photograph, the move is one
portrait render cropped to landscape with Pillow — which also halves the bill.
The still-life style centres its subject in generous negative space, so the
crop is safe. That is a deliberate open option, not an oversight.

Nothing is written back until every requested frame has been drawn and stored.
A first render that succeeds beside a second that fails leaves the article
exactly as it was — which matters most in the case that looks least dangerous,
a cover drawn against a lead that then failed: a tile picture with nothing in
the article to pair it against is the one state ``derive_card`` cannot reason
about.

**Either frame can be drawn on its own** (``frames=``), keeping the other from
``keep=``. That is a reviewer affordance — liking the article's picture and not
the tile's should not cost two renders to fix one — and it is safe for the same
reason the pair was never a photograph and its crop: both frames come from the
same locked, claim-free prompt builder for the same article, so neither can
assert anything the other does not. What it does mean is that provenance had to
move onto the frames themselves; see ``domain/contracts.py::GeneratedImage``.

    """A stable seed for one run — *intended* so a retry redraws the same picture.

    The intent: a run that failed retryably at synthesis and succeeded on
    attempt two is the same article, and re-rolling would show a reviewer a
    different picture on their second look for no reason visible to them.

    **Measured 2026-08-24: the image provider does not honour it.** Two renders
    at identical prompt, size and seed came back byte-different through
    `nscale`, which HF's router reaches via an OpenAI-shaped images endpoint
    that has no seed parameter to carry.

    So the seed is sent to the provider on spec and ignored — but it is **not**
    decorative, because `imagery/prompt.py` uses it to choose the prompt's
    arrangement, framing, light and surface. That selection is ours, runs before
    the request, and cannot be ignored by anyone. The practical effect is the
    one originally wanted: a retried run composes the same photograph, and
    Regenerate composes a different one. What a stable seed no longer buys is
    byte-identical output, so a retry still pays for a second file.

    `fal-ai` and `replicate` do honour seeds and are one `IMAGE_INFERENCE_PROVIDER`
    line away, which would restore that last property too.

    Hashed rather than sliced out of the uuid so it keeps working if run ids
    ever stop being uuids.
