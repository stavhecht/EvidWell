"""The "Let us know" inbox.

Public writes, reviewer-only reads. Two rules worth stating because both are
easy to soften later:

* **A submission is never acted on automatically.** It does not create a
  pipeline run and it does not become a topic. A reviewer reads it and decides,
  which is the same principle as invariant #1 applied at the other end of the
  pipeline: nothing reaches generation because a stranger asked for it.
* **Nothing here is ever shown publicly.** No "recently requested" list, no
  counts. The rows carry an email address and free text written by anyone with
  the URL.
