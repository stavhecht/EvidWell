"""Article media: what the store accepts, and what a document may cite.

Two rules, which are one rule seen from either end:

* **Bytes enter the store only if their content says they are an image.** The
  client's ``Content-Type`` and filename are read and discarded — both are
  attacker-controlled strings, and what this store holds is served straight
  back over HTTP. The first bytes of the file decide.
* **A document may reference only media this store wrote**, plus a YouTube
  video id. A remote ``https://`` image, a ``javascript:`` URL, a hand-typed
  iframe src: all refused, at save time and again at approve time.

SVG is deliberately absent from the allowlist. An SVG is a script-bearing
document; one served from our own origin and embedded in a published article is
stored XSS against every reader of that article. PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP cannot
carry script, which is the whole reason the list is those four.

Storage is content-addressed — the key is the SHA-256 of the bytes. The same
image stored twice is one row, two writers can never collide, and no fragment
of a client-supplied string reaches the key.

**The bytes live in Postgres**, in ``media_objects``, keyed by that digest. They
were on local disk until they turned out to be the one piece of published state
that a database backup did not cover and a container did not carry — a run on
the host wrote files a containerised API then served as 404s, with the paths in
``articles.generated_imagery`` pointing at each one. One store, one backup, one
restore. See ``migrations/0004_media_objects.sql`` for why the table is keyed by
digest rather than hung off ``articles``.

The module is split so the part worth testing hardest needs no database:
``prepare_image()`` is pure — it sniffs, digests, and builds the path a document
will hold — and ``store_image()`` is that plus one INSERT. The seam is still
narrow enough that an S3 version is this module and nothing else (DESIGN.md §11
— deployment is deferred).

Orphan collection is deferred, as it was on disk: an image dropped from a draft
leaves its row behind. Rows are immutable and content-addressed, which makes a
sweep over ``articles.original_content``/``edited_content`` a job that can be
written correctly later — and an easier one now that it is a DELETE with no
filesystem to keep in step.
