"""Rate limiting for the login endpoint.

Without this, ``/auth/login`` is two separate free gifts. It is an unlimited
password oracle against a two-account console whose emails are guessable, and —
less obvious and more immediately dangerous — it is a CPU amplifier: Argon2id is
memory-hard on purpose, so every request costs the server ~100ms and megabytes
while costing the attacker one HTTP call. The dummy-hash call that equalises
timing for unknown emails means even *nonsense* input is expensive. A few
hundred concurrent POSTs is a resource exhaustion attack, not just a guessing
attack, **so the check has to happen before any hashing** or it protects the
password and not the process.

Three deliberate shapes:

**It rejects, it never waits.** The token bucket in ``retrieval/throttle.py``
sleeps to pace outbound calls, which is right for a client and backwards for a
server. A delay only slows a client that chooses to wait for the response — an
attacker firing 500 concurrent requests waits four seconds *in total*, while the
reviewer who mistyped waits four seconds for real. It puts the friction on the
honest user. Rejecting immediately costs us less per request than it costs the
attacker, which is the asymmetry worth having.

**Blocks escalate but always expire.** A flat window is a rate, not a
deterrent — ten guesses a minute forever is fourteen thousand a day. The ladder
below makes sustained attempts progressively unprofitable. It caps, and nothing
here can be extended by an attacker into a permanent block: there is no
user-management endpoint in this API, so an account disabled until an admin
clears it would need a shell on the server to undo, and would hand anyone who
knows a reviewer's email a kill switch on publishing (``approve()`` is the only
path to ``published``).

**Both keys are counted, whether or not the account exists.** ``routes.py``
goes to some trouble to make unknown-email and wrong-password indistinguishable.
Counting failures only against real accounts would undo that immediately: a 429
on an email would confirm the email.

The limit worth stating plainly: with a password alone, blocking distributed
guessing against a known account and guaranteeing that account's owner is never
blocked are not simultaneously achievable. MFA or a trusted-device cookie is
what actually resolves it. Until then the account budget is deliberately loose,
so it fires on a distributed attack rather than on a bad afternoon.
