Deliberately minimal — one admin, JWT bearer, no invite flow — but not a shared

this article" stays answerable indefinitely. That is the part that must not be
compromised for convenience; everything else here can be replaced later without
touching the audit trail.

Argon2id rather than bcrypt: no 72-byte silent truncation, and the memory-hard
parameters are current best practice.
