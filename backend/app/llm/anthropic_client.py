"""Claude-backed implementations of the two generative calls.

Model choices and constraints, for reviewers unfamiliar with this API surface:

* **The two calls run on different models**, because they are different jobs.
  Extraction is a short, mechanical structured response — a small model is
  sufficient. Synthesis is where the product's guarantees live: it must cite
  only supplied handles (invariant #2) and keep its verdict under the evidence
  ceiling (invariant #3), so it gets the stronger model. Both are config, not
  constants — see ``settings.extraction_model`` / ``settings.synthesis_model``.
* Structured outputs via ``messages.parse(output_format=...)``. The response is
  constrained to the Pydantic schema and comes back as a validated instance,
  which eliminates malformed-JSON handling entirely. Supported on every model
  named below; verify before configuring an older one.
* ``temperature`` / ``top_p`` / ``top_k`` are **rejected** on Opus 5 and
  Sonnet 5 — a request carrying them returns a 400. Behaviour is steered by
  prompt only. (Older/smaller models still accept them; this code sends none
  either way, so it is safe across the range.)
* ``max_tokens`` caps thinking **plus** visible output. Synthesis is therefore
  given 8K even though the article is ~300 words; sizing ``max_tokens`` to the
  article would truncate mid-response, and a truncated structured response has
  no parsed output at all — which is why ``_check_truncation`` names the cause
  rather than letting it surface as a schema failure. Both calls always pass an
  explicit cap — never rely on a default.
* **Both calls pass ``thinking`` explicitly.** Whether an omitted ``thinking``
  means "think" or "don't think" varies across the model range (Sonnet 5 and
  Opus 5 think; Opus 4.8 and 4.7 do not), and the model here is config. Passing
  it explicitly is what keeps the token budgets above meaningful regardless of
  ``settings.extraction_model`` / ``settings.synthesis_model``.
* The system prompt is byte-stable across every call and carries the
  ``cache_control`` breakpoint. Anything per-article goes in the user turn,
  after it — a single volatile byte in the prefix would invalidate the cache
  for everything following it.
