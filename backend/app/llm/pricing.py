"""What a model call costs, kept separate from what it consumed.

The database stores tokens; this module turns tokens into dollars at read time.
That split is deliberate. Tokens are a fact about a call that happened and never
change; a price is an external number that does, and baking a cost column into
``pipeline_stage_runs`` would freeze whichever price was current the day the run
executed — with no record of which one it was. Recomputing means a price
correction fixes history instead of leaving it quietly wrong.

The trade is the mirror image: repricing is retroactive, so past runs re-quote at
today's rates. That is the right default while these numbers inform a build
decision rather than a customer invoice. If a run's cost ever has to be *owed*
rather than *estimated*, this becomes a table with effective dates and the
choice above inverts.

**Model ids are provider-namespaced** (``anthropic/claude-sonnet-5``,
``ollama/llama3.1:8b``), matching the convention ``sources.embedding_model``
already uses. Bare model names collide across providers and, worse, make a local
model indistinguishable from a hosted one — which is the difference between free
and not.

Prices are USD per million tokens, **as_of 2026-08-21**, transcribed from
Anthropic's published pricing. Nothing verifies them against a real invoice: no
Anthropic call has been made from this codebase yet (see README, "Verification
status"). Treat a figure here as a documented assumption, and confirm it against
the pricing page before anyone reports a number from it.
