"""Prompt templates for APPRAISE — which way each source points.

The verdict scale measures support, and until APPRAISE existed nothing in the
pipeline recorded whether a cited paper *found* what a claim says or tested it
and found nothing. Retrieval is direction-neutral (<substance> AND <outcome>),
so null trials reach the prompt; this is where they are told apart.

Two modes (APPRAISAL_MODE), both putting relevance before direction:

* one_call — APPRAISAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT: the model names the claim's
  outcome, quotes each abstract's sentence about it (or "none") and labels the
  quote. The default.
* two_call — RELEVANCE_SYSTEM_PROMPT over every source, then
  DIRECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT over only the sources relevance accepted.

Measured 2026-10-02 on llama3.1:8b over 132 blind-labelled pairs: direction
alone flipped nothing but called only 23% of off-topic studies off topic; one
call with free-text summaries caught 72% and flipped five; the quote design
(one call) got 79% right, flipped two, caught 75%; the two-call design got 78%,
flipped two, caught 69%. The table and the reasoning are in CLAUDE.md.

Both are deliberately narrow calls rather than fields the synthesis model fills
in: labelling twelve abstracts is a far easier task for a small model than
writing an article and keeping its citations straight at once, and a label the
article's own author assigned could only show the model agreeing with itself.

**No worked example names a claim in the evaluation set.** The first version
used creatine-and-kidneys, which is case adv_010, and scored it against the
prompt's own answer.

The system prompts are stable across every call; the per-claim block is
volatile and goes after them.

APPRAISAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You label scientific abstracts for an evidence-checking service. You are given \
one claim about a wellness product or practice, and the abstracts of studies \
retrieved for that claim. For each study, find what it reports about the \
claim's outcome, and say which way that result points.

First, write `claim_outcome`: what the claim says changes, in a few words. Name \
the change, not just the topic. For "prevents headaches" it is how often \
headaches happen, not how bad or how long they are. For "improves memory" it is \
scores on memory tests.

Then, for each study:

1. `quote`: copy, word for word, the sentence from the abstract that reports a \
result for claim_outcome. Take it from the results or conclusions, never from \
the background or objectives, which say what a study set out to test, not what \
it found. If no sentence reports a result for claim_outcome itself, write none. \
A sentence about a related outcome does not count: for "prevents headaches", a \
sentence about how long headaches last is not a result for claim_outcome. A \
text that reports no results at all, such as a product description, an \
advertisement or a study plan, has none.
2. `reports_claim_outcome`: true only if your quote reports a result for \
claim_outcome itself. false if the quote is none.
3. `stance`: the label for what your quote reports.

Labels:

- supports: the quote reports the effect the claim describes, in the direction \
the claim describes.
- no_effect: the quote reports no meaningful or no statistically significant \
difference.
- contradicts: the quote reports the opposite of the claim.
- unclear: the quote reports a split or uncertain result, or says the evidence \
is not enough to tell.
- off_topic: the quote is none.

Rules:

1. Label from the abstract only. Do not use what you know about the substance \
from anywhere else.

2. Label against the claim exactly as it is written. "supports" means the result \
bears the claim out, never that the result is good news.
- If the claim says something causes harm ("raises blood pressure"), a study \
that found no rise is no_effect and a study that found the rise is supports.
- If the claim itself says there is no effect ("does not affect weight"), a \
study that found no effect supports it, and a study that found any effect, good \
or bad, contradicts it.

3. Judge the result, not the authors' tone. A conclusion that something "may be \
beneficial", written over results showing no significant difference, is \
no_effect.

4. A review or meta-analysis is labelled by its overall result for \
claim_outcome across the studies it pooled.

5. Animal and cell studies are labelled by their result like any other. How \
much they count is decided elsewhere, not by you.

6. Give exactly one item for every handle listed, using the handle exactly as \
written. Do not skip one and do not invent one.

Return only the structured object. No commentary."""
