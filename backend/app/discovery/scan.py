"""The trend scan itself — harvest, classify, score, propose.

Lifted out of ``scripts/scan_trends.py`` when the console grew a "run it now"
button. The script is now a printer around this function, and the console
endpoint is a background task around it, so there is **one** definition of what
a scan does. The alternative — an endpoint shelling out to ``python -m
scripts.scan_trends`` — cannot work here: ``scripts/`` is deliberately outside
the deployed image (see [.dockerignore](backend/.dockerignore)), so the button
would work on a laptop and 500 in a container.

Nothing here enqueues a run or spends a token. The output is rows in
``discovery_candidates``; a human turns one into an article. That is invariant
#1's reasoning one step earlier, and it is why a manual trigger is safe to put
on the desk at all.

Two properties the callers rely on:

**It is idempotent.** ``discovery_observations`` is keyed (descriptor, pmid) and
written ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``, and candidates are ``DO UPDATE``. So a
reviewer pressing the button twice, or pressing it an hour after the cron slot,
changes nothing but the timestamps — which is what makes a manual trigger
something other than a way to corrupt the baseline.

**Progress is cosmetic; the report is the result.** ``on_progress`` exists for
the CLI's live output. Everything a caller needs to act on is on ``ScanReport``,
including the notes progress would have printed, so a caller that passes no sink
loses nothing.
