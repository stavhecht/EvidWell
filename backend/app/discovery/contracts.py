"""What flows between the discovery stages.

Mirrors ``domain/contracts.py``'s role for the pipeline: every boundary in this
package takes and returns one of these, so a change to the shape fails at the
seam rather than three functions later.

The one deliberate absence is a paper's abstract. Discovery counts index terms,
never prose — an abstract-less MEDLINE record carries the full signal, which is
precisely why this package does not reuse ``CandidatePaper``.
