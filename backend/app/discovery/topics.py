"""Turning a MeSH descriptor into a topic string a reviewer would have typed.

The output of this module becomes ``pipeline_runs.topic`` verbatim, which makes
it the narrowest and most consequential surface in the package: it is the only
thing discovery contributes to an article, and everything downstream —
``product``, ``ingredients``, the PubMed query, the verdict — is derived from it
by the extraction model.

That is also where the sharpest failure lives. ``TemplateQueryStrategy`` raises
``UnanchoredQuery`` when neither ``product`` nor ``ingredients`` names a
substance, and ``RetrieveStage`` converts it to a **non-retryable** stage
failure. So a topic phrased in a way that leads extraction to return
``ingredients: []`` and a vague ``product`` burns a model call and dies. The
shape below — bare substance first, outcome after "for" — is deliberately the
shape ``CreateRunRequest.topic`` documents and the extraction prompt was tuned
on ('ashwagandha for stress').

    on 2026-09-06 show the three ways it goes wrong:

    the candidate is promoted. Anything else is not refused: the substance is
