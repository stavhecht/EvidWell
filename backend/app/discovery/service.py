"""Persistence for trend discovery: the ledger, the baselines, the proposals.

Everything that touches the database lives here, and everything that decides
*what* is worth proposing lives in ``scoring.py``. The split is deliberate —
``suppression_reason`` in particular is a pure function over history the caller
has already loaded, so the dry run can explain a suppression without a second
query and the rule can be tested without a database.

One rule governs every write in this module: **counts are never incremented.**
Observations are keyed ``(descriptor_ui, pmid)`` and written ``ON CONFLICT DO
NOTHING``, so a scan re-reading weeks a previous scan already covered — which
every scan does, because MeSH indexing lags PubMed entry — is a no-op rather
than double counting.
