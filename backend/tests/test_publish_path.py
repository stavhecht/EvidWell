"""Structural guard on invariant #1.

Behavioural tests prove that today's code publishes only via review. This one
proves that *tomorrow's* code still does — it fails when someone adds a second
place that can set an article to `published`, which is the regression a
behavioural test cannot see coming.

It is a grep, and deliberately so: it needs no database, runs in milliseconds,
and is the cheapest possible tripwire on the guarantee the whole product rests
on. If it fires, the question to answer is not "how do I make the test pass"
but "should this second path exist at all".
