"""Scan newly-indexed PubMed literature for emerging wellness/sports trends.

Ranks substances by how fast their evidence base is growing and proposes the top
ones to a reviewer, who decides which become articles. **Nothing here enqueues a
run or spends a token** — the output is rows in ``discovery_candidates``, and a
human turns one into an article from the console.

Dry by default::

    python -m scripts.scan_trends                      # report only
    python -m scripts.scan_trends --apply              # write observations + candidates
    python -m scripts.scan_trends --bootstrap --apply  # build the baseline, propose nothing
    python -m scripts.scan_trends --seed botanicals    # one net, for debugging

**The scan itself lives in `app/discovery/scan.py`**, not here. This file is
argparse and printing around ``run_scan``; the console's "Run scan" button is a
background task around the same function. A second implementation behind the
button would be a second answer to "what is a scan", free to drift from the one
the cron slot runs.

Two things differ from the sibling maintenance scripts, both worth knowing
before running this:

**The dry run still makes the network calls.** There is no way to score without
them — unlike ``reclassify_sources``, whose dry run is free. It writes nothing.

**``--bootstrap`` refuses to run without ``--apply``**, because a dry bootstrap
is 400+ PubMed requests producing output nobody keeps.

Schedule it weekly rather than fortnightly. Cron has no fortnightly expression
and the usual parity hack needs ``%`` escaped or the line silently never runs —
the most common way a cron job dies unnoticed. Cadence is not a correctness
variable here: the observation ledger is keyed (descriptor, pmid), so a scan
re-reading a window a previous scan already counted changes nothing, and
``--limit`` controls how much reaches the desk independently.

    15 6 * * 1 cd /srv/evidwell/backend && /srv/evidwell/.venv/bin/python \\
        -m scripts.scan_trends --apply >> /var/log/evidwell/scan_trends.log 2>&1

06:15 Monday on purpose: outside the hours a reviewer is queueing runs, so the
scan and the worker are not competing for the same NCBI per-IP ceiling.
