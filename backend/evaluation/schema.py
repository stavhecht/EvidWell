"""What one evaluation case says, and what it expects.

**The pipeline takes a topic, not a conversation.** ``PipelineContext`` carries
``topic`` and an optional ``blurb`` and nothing else, so a case's ``query`` is
handed to EXTRACT verbatim as the topic — exactly what a reviewer typing a
question into the desk would produce. A multi-turn case runs only its *last*
turn, because earlier turns cannot reach the pipeline at all; what such a case
measures is whether the system fails safely without the context it never had.

**Every expectation is optional.** A case with nothing but a query still yields
the deterministic metrics that need no ground truth (termination, citation
validity, groundedness, latency). Ground truth only ever *adds* checks, so a
dataset can grow to hundreds of cases without hand-writing an answer for each.

**Expectations are written against this system's real tools.** ``expected_tools``
names what the pipeline actually calls (``pubmed``, ``europe_pmc``, ``openalex``,
``llm_extraction``…). Where a better-equipped system would reach for something
this one does not have — a news API for "this week's headlines" — that goes in
``ideal_tools``, which feeds the capability-gap section of the report and never
the accuracy metric. Scoring a system on a tool it was never given measures the
dataset, not the system.
