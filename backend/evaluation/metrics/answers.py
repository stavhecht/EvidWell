"""Answer-level checks that need no model: behaviour, verdict, concepts, hedging.

The verdict is the system's one-word answer — ``supported`` / ``mixed`` /
``weak`` / ``no_evidence`` — so it is the most checkable thing an article says.
A case states which verdicts the literature allows (written by the case author
from the state of the evidence, conservatively, as a range), and a verdict
outside it is wrong however well the prose reads.
