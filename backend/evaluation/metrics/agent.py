"""Did the pipeline call the right tools, take the right branches, and stop?

The article pipeline is not a free-roaming tool-calling agent. Which tools run
is decided by code: every enabled provider is searched for every anchored
claim, and the graph has exactly three branch points — refine (RANK ->
RETRIEVE), the coverage re-prompt inside SYNTHESIZE, and revise (VALIDATE ->
SYNTHESIZE) — plus two hard stops (an unanchored query, every search failing)
and one model-free branch (zero sources -> the no-evidence template). So "tool
selection" here has two halves, both checked:

* **Tool selection**: were the expected tools called, and were forbidden ones
  not? Expected tools default from the case's behaviour and the enabled
  providers; a provider quietly missing from the run (the compose ``.env``
  trap that dropped OpenAlex) shows up as a missing tool call.
* **Decisions**: at each branch point the design says what *must* happen. Each
  rule below is checked only where it applies, and every one is taken from the
  system's own documentation, not invented here.

Repeated calls are split by cause: an identical request after a 429 or a
throttle body is a *retry* (expected, bounded); after a success it is
*redundant*. Only the second counts as an unnecessary call.
