"""Latency, call counts, tokens and cost.

Two latencies, never mixed. **Wall clock** is what this run took, and in
``cached`` mode it is mostly replay — fast and meaningless as a performance
number. **Live latency** is what each external call cost when it was actually
made (recorded with the response and replayed with it), which is the honest
per-call figure whichever mode the run used. The report gives both and says
how much of the run was replayed.

Cost comes from ``llm/pricing.py`` and keeps its rule: an unpriced model is
``None``, never ``0``. Local Ollama models cost nothing to run but most are not
in the price table, so a local run typically reports cost as unpriced.
