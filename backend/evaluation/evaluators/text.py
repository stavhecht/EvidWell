"""Deterministic reading of a generated article: statements, citations, numbers.

These checks need no model, so they cannot share the generator's blind spots,
and they are cheap enough to run on every sentence. They are deliberately
narrow — each answers one mechanical question:

* **Which sentence cites what.** Markers are parsed with the production
  ``CITATION_MARKER_RE``, so "cited" means exactly what the renderer and the
  validator mean by it.
* **Is every number in a cited sentence present in the sources it cites?** The
  sharpest hallucination signal available without a model: a statistic is
  either in the abstract (or the full-text excerpt the model was shown) or it
  was made up. Rounding is tolerated; a counted number of sources ("three
  trials") is not checked, since it is the model counting citations, not
  quoting a paper.
* **How much of a sentence's vocabulary appears in its sources.** A coarse
  lexical-support score. It cannot tell "reduced" from "did not reduce", which
  is why the LLM judge exists; it can tell a sentence that shares nothing with
  its source from one that paraphrases it.

The validator already checks that every *block* (beat 2, each section) carries
a citation. This module looks one level down, at sentences: a section with one
cited sentence and four uncited findings passes validation and fails
``citation_completeness`` here.
