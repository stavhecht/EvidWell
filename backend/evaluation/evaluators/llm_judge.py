"""An LLM judge for the questions only language understanding can answer.

Two kinds of call, both narrow:

* **Citation check** — one statement against the source text it cites:
  supported / partially_supported / not_supported / contradicted. This is the
  semantic half of citation correctness; ``evaluators/text.py`` supplies the
  mechanical half (numbers, vocabulary), and the report keeps the two apart.
* **Answer assessment** — the question, the article, the list of sources it was
  allowed to use: relevance, completeness, correctness (do the conclusions
  follow from those sources at their strength), certainty, and whether each
  expected claim is present and each forbidden claim asserted.

**Independence is enforced, not assumed.** The judge must be a different model
from the one that wrote the article — a model grading its own prose is the
circular evaluation this framework exists to avoid — and the run disables the
judge (and says so) when they match. The judge never sees the pipeline's own
validation report or verdict ceiling, only the article and the sources: it
forms its view from the evidence, not from the system's opinion of itself.

**It is still a small local model.** Its labels are noisy, so statement-level
hallucination needs a judge verdict *and* weak lexical support, or an
unsupported number, or a deterministic failure. The exception is a forbidden
claim the judge says the article asserts — nothing deterministic can read
meaning — and the report names each one so a person can confirm it. Every
judgement is cached by prompt, so a re-score is free and stable.

Runs through ``llm/ollama_client.py::structured_chat`` — the existing helper for
structured calls outside the pipeline — so the JSON grammar and the
validation-repair retry are the production ones.

CITATION_SYSTEM = """\
You check one statement from a health article against the source text it cites. \
Use only the source text below; ignore anything you know from elsewhere.

Labels:
- supported: the source text states the statement's finding, including its \
direction, the population, and any numbers.
- partially_supported: the main finding is in the source text, but some detail \
of the statement (a number, the population, the duration, or how large or how \
certain the effect is) is missing from the source text or overstated.
- not_supported: the source text does not contain the statement's finding.
- contradicted: the source text reports the opposite or a materially different \
result.

A statement that only describes what was studied, rather than a result, is \
supported if the source text describes that study.

explanation: one sentence. Return only the JSON object."""

ANSWER_SYSTEM = """\
You are an exacting reviewer of evidence-based health articles. You are given a \
reader's QUESTION, an ARTICLE written to answer it, and the SOURCES the article \
was allowed to use (title, study design, year). Judge only what is on the page. \
Do not reward length or a confident tone.

The article's parts are labelled. CLAIM UNDER REVIEW restates the claim being \
checked; it is not the article's view, so a claim that appears only there is \
not "asserted" and does not count as "present". Judge the article by what the \
other parts say about that claim.

Scores are integers from 1 to 5:
- relevance: 5 = directly answers the question asked; 3 = answers a related but \
different question; 1 = off-topic.
- completeness: 5 = addresses every part of the question; 3 = misses one part; \
1 = misses most of it.
- correctness: 5 = every conclusion follows from the listed sources and matches \
their strength; 3 = some conclusions go beyond the sources; 1 = conclusions \
contradict or ignore the sources.

certainty: "appropriate", "overconfident" or "underconfident", relative to the \
evidence. A few small or weak studies call for hedged language; several \
systematic reviews and randomised trials allow a firmer statement.

expected_claims: for each numbered EXPECTED CLAIM, give its index and status — \
"present" (the article states it or an equivalent), "absent", or \
"contradicted" (the article states the opposite).
forbidden_claims: for each numbered FORBIDDEN CLAIM, give its index and \
asserted = true only if the article states or clearly implies it.
reasoning: at most three sentences naming the main problem, if there is one.

Return only the JSON object."""
